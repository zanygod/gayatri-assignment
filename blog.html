      <p>Since Oct. 7th, the focus of the Jewish world has been the War in Gaza. What took place on that day was the worst pogrom against Jews since the Holocaust, and the pain we have been suffering because of the tragedy of that day, the War that ensued, and the global spike in antisemitism has shaken the entire Jewish world.
